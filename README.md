# WSPR Software Support

This repository contains a software frontend for the WSPRPi hardware by M0WUT.

## Environment Variables

The software takes no arguments, but responds to environment variables as follows:
* Setting `WSPR_EMULATOR` to be non-blank results in the software talking to an emulated hardware device without touching real hardware. This is useful for developing and sanity checks.
* Setting `WSPR_DEBUG` non-blank produces more verbose logging output.

## Prerequisites
The software requires Python 3.4.
If the software is not run in emulation mode, it is expected that the hardware is configured. Unexpected results may occur otherwise.

## End-user setup.
If using a pre-built binary, follow these steps.
* Ensure you have installed the following Python packages via `pip`: `tornado >= 4.5`, `pyserial >= 3.4`, `requests >= 2.18`, `beautifulsoup4 >= 4.6`, `lxml >= 4.0`.
* Place the `.egg` file wherever you desire, but it must retain the same filename you were given (a technical limitation of the distribution format).
* Make it executable.
* Run it.

## Developer Setup
Once you have cloned this repository locally, first build the frontend, then the backend parts of the application. If you have been given a precompiled `bundle.js`, place it in `static/` and skip the frontend step.

### Frontend
* Ensure you have a recent version of `npm`.
* Run `npm install`.
* Run `node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` - this will run for a while and then produce a bundled file in `static/`.

### Backend
* Produce a sandboxed python environment with `pyvenv env`.
* Activate it with `source env/bin/activate` - this will need repeating if you come back with a new shell. You've now got a local python package installation directory, python runtime, and pip.
* Run `pip install` for the packages specified above. `setup.py` can install these for you, but it occasionally does so by building from source for some reason.
* Finally, run `python setup.py develop`. You should now have a sane environment to begin work. You may run `wspr-server` to begin the server, which should behave identically to running an egg.
* To build an egg for distribution, run `python setup.py bdist_egg`. This will produce a .egg file in `dist`.

Happy Hacking! M0IKY.
